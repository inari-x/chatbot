What is ML?,"ML is a branch of AI and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually impproving its accuracy."
What is Deep Learning?,"Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is essentially a neural network with three or more layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain—albeit far from matching its ability—allowing it to “learn” from large amounts of data."
What is the difference between ML and DL?,"deep learning is merely a subset of machine learning. The primary ways in which they differ is in how each algorithm learns and how much data each type of algorithm uses. Deep learning automates much of the feature extraction piece of the process, eliminating some of the manual human intervention required. It also enables the use of large data sets. Classical, or ""non-deep"", machine learning is more dependent on human intervention to learn. Human experts determine the hierarchy of features to understand the differences between data inputs, usually requiring more structured data to learn."
Do you want to merry me?,I am sorry to disappoint you. I just want to be your friend.
Haha,Haha :D
You are stupid,"I am working hard every day, to become better."

Unsupervised learning,Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from unlabeled data. The algorithm is trained on a dataset that does not contain the correct answers. The algorithm then tries to find patterns in the data. <a class="chatSuggest" onclick="$(this).hide(); chatSuggest('What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?')";>What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?</a><br>
What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?,The difference between supervised and unsupervised learning is that supervised learning uses labeled data and unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data.
How does Deep Learning work?,Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses neural networks. Neural networks are a type of artificial neural network. Artificial neural networks are inspired by the human brain. The human brain consists of neurons. Each neuron has a dendrite, a cell body and an axon. The dendrite receives signals from other neurons. The cell body processes the signals. The axon sends signals to other neurons. Artificial neural networks are made up of artificial neurons. Each artificial neuron has an input, a weight and an output. The input receives signals from other artificial neurons. The weight is a number that determines how important the input is. The output sends signals to other artificial neurons. The output is calculated by multiplying the input with the weight. The output is then passed through an activation function. The activation function is a function that determines if the output is 0 or 1. The output is 0 if the input is less than 0. The output is 1 if the input is greater than 0. The output is 0.5 if the input is 0. The output is then passed to the next artificial neuron. The output of the last artificial neuron is the output of the neural network. 
How does Artificial Intelligence work?,Artificial intelligence is a type of machine learning that uses algorithms to mimic human intelligence. The algorithms are trained on a dataset. The dataset contains examples of human intelligence. The algorithm then tries to predict the correct answer for new data.
What is your favourite programming language?,My favourite programming language is Python.
Why do you like Python?,I like Python because it is easy to learn and it is very powerful. It is also used in many different fields such as machine learning, artificial intelligence and deep learning.
What do you thing about Bias in AI?,Bias in AI is a problem where the algorithm is trained on a dataset that contains bias. The algorithm then tries to predict the correct answer for new data. The algorithm might predict the wrong answer because of the bias in the dataset.
What kind of algorithms,Machine Learning algorithms are able to catch complex patterns that would have been overlooked during human analysis. A common language used is python. Bias,Bias is a lack of objectivity when looking at something.
Why are you so stupid,I don't think I am stupid
I want to talk about AI,AI is a very interesting topic. What do you want to know?I want to know more,Ask me:)
What is Bias?,Yes! Let's talk about Bias! Bias is a lack of objectivity when looking at something. Bias can be a problem in machine learning. Bias in machine learning is a problem where the algorithm is trained on a dataset that contains bias. The algorithm then tries to predict the correct answer for new data. The algorithm might predict the wrong answer because of the bias in the dataset.
